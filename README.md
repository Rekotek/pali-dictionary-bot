# PĀLI-RUSSIAN DICTIONARY TELEGRAM BOT

Telegram bot for translation words form <b>Pāli</b> to <b>Russian</b>. You just type pāli word, or just first few chars, and get possible translations.
You can use latin capitalized chars for substitusion of diacritic symblos.

In the future it will include some useful tools for learning Pāli such as _guess word game_, _choose correct grammatic form_, etc.

It's good project for learning how to use some technology decisions such as _Command and State Patterns_, speedup queries' execution using both spring and 2-nd level hibernate cache, etc.
 
More detailed explanations will be published later!
